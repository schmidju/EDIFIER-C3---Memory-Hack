# Python Digital Analyer tool

This tool can be used with sigrock on windows and a digital analyzer.
I wrote it for easy decoding the TWI protocol.

Start it using the decode.py

You can make changes to edifier.py while running decode.py and it will automatically reimport edifier.py.
No need to restart while testing is really handy.
